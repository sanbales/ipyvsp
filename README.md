# ipyvsp
A `experimental` pythonic Vehicle Sketch Pad.

## Purpose
Explore the feasibility of a pythonic parametric vehicle definition framework can be developed.

Inspired by the excellent [OpenVSP](http://openvsp.org/).

## Status
This repository is in its very early stages.  It currently only has some experiments on patterns to use for defining shapes and elements using [traitlets](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets).
